Description: Graylog2 is an open source syslog implementation
 that stores your logs in ElasticSearch. It consists of a
 server written in Java that accepts your syslog messages
 via TCP or UDP and stores it in the database. The second
 part is a Ruby on Rails web interface that allows you to
 view the log messages.
